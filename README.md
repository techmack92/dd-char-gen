Overall this application was created to create an immersive character generator that anyone can use even if you know nothing about D&D!

## Technologies 

- Dalle-3

If you havent created an account, you can click the signup button and you will be directed to the signup form where you can create a user. Once you've created your log in credentials, head to the log in page and use your newly created credentials to sign in to your account. Now the youre logged in you should be presented with a prompt page with inputs for: Name, Race, Class, and a Description/Backstory as well as stat distribution. Enter your character information along with the stats you want them to have, hit "Generate Character" and let the magic happen! Once youv'e created a character they will be saved under the "My Characters page" where you can return and view them later. You can create as many characters as you want so dont hesitate to get carried away!
